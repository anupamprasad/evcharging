Based on this specification, I also need you to create a todo list, to help build features in logical order. 

Example of phases and tasks:

1. Setup
- initial setup with Vite
- installing project dependencies
- Create the layout 
- Create a functional prototype with working functionality (like drag and drop)

2. Set up the Supabase project and database

3. Basic functionality (adding, moving card)

4. Advanced functionality (adding/editing/deleting columns)
