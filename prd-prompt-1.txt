I need to write a software specification (PRD), and I need your help with writing it. The output should be formatted as Markdown and should not use emojis.

I want to build a Trello-style kanban board using Vite and dnd-kit with drag & drop functionality and beautiful design. 

Here are some features I think I will need:

- Multiple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) that can hold task cards
- Smooth drag and drop functionality between columns
- Ability to add new cards to any column
- Ability to edit in place a card name
- Ability to add new columns
- Ability to rename columns
- Ability to delete columns
- Storage using Supabase

Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear BEFORE you start generating.
